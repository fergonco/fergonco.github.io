In this post we will be implementing JWT based authentication.

how does the token authentication works.

Why: stateless discussion + microservices

Challenges:

* Logout
* Deal with expiration: short lived tokens (recomended practice) + renewal
* Returned on a custom header (because of the renewal)

Weak points:

* No secret rotation
* No real logout (we should keep a black list of tokens)
* token hijacking (we didn't implement any browser fingerprinting because that can be also tampered by an attacker)
