# Fernando González Cortés

Working as a professional developer since 2003. I have +15 years of experience with geographical information, specially building GIS tools.

I am self-taught person. I started with computers reading a Basic reference documentation when I was 13. It took me a while to understand that "character" was not about my computer personality. Big letdown. Currently trying to get to a decent level on statistics and machine learning.

I try to get a deep knowledge of the technologies I work with. I have worked with these:

* GeoServer
* PostgreSQL/PostGIS
* Javascript/Webpack/Babel/HTML/CSS
* GDAL, Geotools, JTS
* Java, Spring
* Python, Django
* Junit, Mockito, Jasmine, Jenkins, Travis
* Git

I am a founder member of geomati.co (http://geomati.co)

# Works

I have developed on my own:

## Border rampage

## Javascript Constraint Satisfaction Problem Solver

## Timegod

## GDMS abstraction layer to access GIS data sources and execute SQL queries on them.

## GGL geoprocessing language

# Team work

You can take a look at my daily activities in my [blog](/blog.html).

A list of my personal projects (to be completed!):

* [Border rampage](http://fergonco.org/2017/08/07/Traffic-prediction-based-on-public-transport-transit-times-%28I%29): A map showing the speeds of the public transport in the border between Geneva (Switzerland) and Pays de Gex (France). It allows to browse the last 24 hours of measured data and 24h of forecasted data. No longer online, but there are a series of posts in [my blog (Traffic prediction based on public transport transit times)](/blog.html).
* [Music Jargon](https://fergonco.github.io/MusicJargon/): Work in progress. A text based music notation. Useful to quickly draft ideas, share them. Finally you can do a *git diff* on your compositions.

My last work:

* [Bankgeheimnisse](https://www.bankgeheimnisse.ch) / [Secrets bancaires](http://secrets-bancaires.ch/): A live community of bench loving people.
