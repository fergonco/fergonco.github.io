# Fernando González Cortés

I am an independent software developer. My main interests are open source, geographical information systems, statistics and artificial intelligence.

As a software developer I care about:

* What the client tries to achieve and how best software can help.
* Finding simple solutions that avoid adding complexity to the codebase.
* Automating tests and other development best practices, so that the software is stable and the development pace does not fall.
* Studying how project goals and requirements relate to tasks a software team needs to execute on.

# Works

I have developed on my own:

## Border rampage

## Javascript Constraint Satisfaction Problem Solver

## Timegod

## GDMS abstraction layer to access GIS data sources and execute SQL queries on them.

## GGL geoprocessing language

# Team work
-->
You can take a look at my daily activities in my [blog](/blog.html).

A list of my personal projects (to be completed!):

* [Border rampage](http://fergonco.org/border-rampage/): Work in progress. A map that shows the speeds of the public transport in the border between Geneva and Saint Genis-Pouilly and Ferney Voltaire and allows to browse the last 24 hours of this data.
