A list of my personal projects (to be completed!):

* [Border rampage](http://fergonco.org/2017/08/07/Traffic-prediction-based-on-public-transport-transit-times-%28I%29): A map showing the speeds of the public transport in the border between Geneva (Switzerland) and Pays de Gex (France). It allows to browse the last 24 hours of measured data and 24h of forecasted data. No longer online, but there are a series of posts in [my blog (Traffic prediction based on public transport transit times)](/blog.html).
* [Music Jargon](https://fergonco.github.io/MusicJargon/): Work in progress. A text based music notation. Useful to quickly draft ideas, share them. Finally you can do a *git diff* on your compositions.

My last work:

* [Bankgeheimnisse](https://www.bankgeheimnisse.ch) / [Secrets bancaires](http://secrets-bancaires.ch/): A live community of bench loving people.
