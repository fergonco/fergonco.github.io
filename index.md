# Fernando González Cortés

I am an independent software developer. My main interests are open source, geographical information systems, statistics and artificial intelligence.

As a software developer I care about:

* What the client tries to achieve and how best software can help.
* Finding simple solutions that avoid adding complexity to the codebase.
* Automating tests and other development best practices, so that the software is stable and the development pace does not drop.
* Studying how project goals and requirements relate to tasks a software team needs to execute on.

# Works

I have developed on my own:

## Border rampage

## Javascript Constraint Satisfaction Problem Solver

## Timegod

## GDMS abstraction layer to access GIS data sources and execute SQL queries on them.

## GGL geoprocessing language

# Team work

You can take a look at my daily activities in my [blog](/blog.html).

A list of my personal projects (to be completed!):

* [Border rampage](http://fergonco.org/2017/08/07/Traffic-prediction-based-on-public-transport-transit-times-%28I%29): A map that shows the speeds of the public transport in the border between Geneva and Saint Genis-Pouilly and Ferney Voltaire and allows to browse the last 24 hours of this data. No longer online, but there are a series of posts in [my blog](/blog.html).
* [Music Jargon](https://fergonco.github.io/MusicJargon/): Work in progress. A text based music notation. Useful to quickly draft ideas, share them. Finally you can do a *git diff* on your compositions.

I am currently the developer of:

* [Bankgeheimnisse](https://www.bankgeheimnisse.ch) / [Secrets bancaires](http://secrets-bancaires.ch/): A live community of bench loving people.

I have been part of these development teams:

* [gvSIG CE](http://gvsigce.org/)
* [OrbisGIS](http://orbisgis.org/)
