# Fernando González Cortés

![fergonco][foto] Independent software developer whose main interests are Open Source, Geographical Information Systems, statistics and Artificial Intelligence.

As a software developer I care about:

* Analysing the requirements of the software, in order to implement only those functionalities that are really needed.
* Being able to find simple solutions that avoid adding complexity to the codebase.
* Automating enough tests, so that the product is stable and can evolve safely.
* Studying how project goals relate to tasks a software team needs to execute on.
