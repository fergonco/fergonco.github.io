# Software developper

Development culture (TODO): Focus on reusability, maintainability, long term view

I maintain a blog that provides insight in the technical aspects of the work I am doing at each moment.

My main other interest is to get my baby to drink the biberon without spilling the milk all over.

When she allows me, I like to write. In case you understand Spanish: TODO link.

And if you are looking for an amazing progressive-rock drummer, just drop me a line: we can find one together. If you don't need such a beast, maybe I can be your man. Some pics: TODO: local, challex, boda
