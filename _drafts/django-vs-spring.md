In Django you can choose to implement your API methods as functions or as classes. There is some duplication of the API to do the same things: function decorators or mixin inheritance.

Then there are exceptions because of the very nature of inheritance (search one) and documentation is not so thorough as in Spring.

Then you have different things that in the Java ecosystem are basically agreed in jcp. In django i have read (we should ask "Tom") to see if this solution (hack) is aligned with future plans.
